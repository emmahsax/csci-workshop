# vigenere_cipher

This is not my code. This code was written primarily by [Aaron Lemmon](https://github.com/lemmo031) and [Thomas Hagen](https://github.com/rabid-angel), but I fixed it up and made it a little more "rubified". 

The vigenere code is a polyalphabetic cipher in which the key (a word) is used to decode each character of a string. There is also a decrypt file which, given the correct key will decrypt a string. `KeyLengthHelper.rb` was used to help generate some letter frequencies that are used (by simply counting up the amount of times each letter is used in a string to be decoded).
