# InterviewQuestions

Three problems that I had to work on for an interview I had during my senior year of college, in October 2016. Per request from the company, I will not say what company the interview was for. For each problem, I was given thirty minutes to solve all of them. Only one solution is incomplete. In hindsight, I think I should've used a directory object and a file object and created a tree to store the data, but hindsight's 20/20.
