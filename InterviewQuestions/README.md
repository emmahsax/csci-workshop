# InterviewQuestions

Three problems that I had to work on for an interview I had during my senior year of college, in October 2016. Per request from the company, I will not say what company the interview was for. For each problem, I was given thirty minutes to solve all of them. Only one solution is incomplete. In hindsight, I think I should've used a directory object and a file object and created a tree to store the data, but hindsight's 20/20.

* `equilibrium_index.rb`
* `largest_adjacent_average.rb`
* `longest_path_to_image.rb`

One problem that I was tasked to work on during an interview in February of 2022. I was given 40 minutes to complete this problem.

* `filtering_output_logs.sh`
