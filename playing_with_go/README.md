This is a directory of resources as I learned more about Go!

So far, here's a list of the tutorials and resources I've used:

* [Master Go Programming: The Complete Go Bootcamp 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-go-programming-complete-golang-bootcamp/)
* [Converting JSON blobs to Go structs](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/)
* [Converting JSON to other languages, too](https://transform.tools/json-to-go)
