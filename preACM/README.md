# preACM

All of the resources in this repository were compiled for either ACM or Digi-Key (or both). However, all of these could come in handy at any programming competition. For example, included in this are examples of scanners, exceptions, memoization, and everything here was compiled by Emma Sax, Aaron Lemmon, Thomas Harren, and Elliott Beach.

Feel free to shoot a pull request my way if there are any more examples of what could come in handy when we go to programming competitions!
