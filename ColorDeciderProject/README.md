# ColorDeciderProject

When I choreographed my first dance for UMM Dance ensemble, each dancer had a different color shirt. I coded that to help me decide which color each dancer had, based on the following:
- no dancer that started the dance next to each other could have the same color shirt
- no dancer that ended the dance next to each other could have the same color shirt
- there may have also been requests

Run by running the main method in the `ColorDeciderProject.java` file.
