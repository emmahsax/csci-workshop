# Learning Computer Science [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/49193a2acd2cc323a802/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/emmasax4/LearningComputerScience/maintainability) ![Default](https://github.com/emmasax4/LearningComputerScience/workflows/Default/badge.svg)

A hodge-podge of various experiments with trying different projects in order to learn little bits about computer science and coding. Some of these are little coding questions, some are a little more "project-like", such as `vigenere_cipher` and `ColorDeciderProject`, but nothing in here is too complex.

Some of these projects use Ruby, some use Java, and at least one even uses Javascript.
