# Learning Computer Science [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/emmasax1/LearningComputerScience/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/emmasax1/LearningComputerScience)

A hodge-podge of various experiments with trying different projects in order to learn little bits about computer science and coding. Some of these are little coding questions, some are a little more "project-like", such as vigenere_cipher and ColorDeciderProject, but nothing in here is too complex.
