# Computer Science (CSci) Workshop

A hodge-podge of various experiments with trying different projects in order to learn little bits about computer science and coding. Some of these are little coding questions, some are a little more "project-like", such as `vigenere_cipher` and `ColorDeciderProject`, but nothing in here is too complex.

Some of these projects use Ruby, some use Java, and at least one even uses Javascript.
