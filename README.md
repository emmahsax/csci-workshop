# Learning Computer Science [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/fbd27e74ae9b89178406/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/emma-sax4/LearningComputerScience/maintainability)

A hodge-podge of various experiments with trying different projects in order to learn little bits about computer science and coding. Some of these are little coding questions, some are a little more "project-like", such as `vigenere_cipher` and `ColorDeciderProject`, but nothing in here is too complex.
