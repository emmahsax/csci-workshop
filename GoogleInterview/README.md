# GoogleInterview

Three problems that I had to work on for my Google interview in October 2016. One of them is a practice problem, and I was given 30 minutes to complete. The others were for-real problems, and I was given 1 hour to solve both of them. I completed the first one and successfully submitted it, but the second gave me some more trouble. In hindsight, I think I should've used a directory object and a file object and created a tree to store the data, but hindsight's 20/20.
