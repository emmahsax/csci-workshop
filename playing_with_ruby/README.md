# playing_with_ruby

This is a repository that I'm going to use to play a little bit more with Ruby and trying to understand the basics of it a little more.

There were a couple Ruby tutorials and resources that I used to help me. Any materials I gathered from those are in labeled directories. They were:

* Ruby in Twenty Minutes: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/
* Learn Ruby the Hard Way: http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/
* About Ruby: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/
* Ruby on Rails: Screencasts: http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts/
* Try Ruby: http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0
* Ruby on Rails Tutorial: https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux/

The following links could be helpful later for referencing back to:

* Ruby Symbol Review: http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex37.html
* Ruby Style Guide: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
