## A look at for loops and the different ways for loops can be written.

the_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'pears', 'apricots']
change = [1, 'pennies', 2, 'dimes', 3, 'quarters']

# this first kind of for-loop: goes through a list
# in a more traditional style found in other languages
for i in the_count
  puts "This is count #{i}"
end

# if we were to write the previous loop in the .each style, it would look like this:
#the_count.each do |i|
#	puts "This is count #{i}"
#end

# same as above, but in a more Ruby style
# this and the next one are the preferred 
# way Ruby for-loops are written
fruits.each do |fruit|
  puts "A fruit of type: #{fruit}"
end

# also we can go through mixed lists too
# note this is yet another style, exactly like above
# but a different syntax (way to write it).
#change.each {|i| puts "I got #{i}"}
change.each do |i|
	puts "I got #{i}"
end

# we can also build lists, first start with an empty one
elements = []

# then use the range operator to do 0 to 5 counts
(0..5).each do |i|
  puts "adding #{i} to the list."
  # pushes the i variable on the *end* of the list
  elements.push(i)
end

# now we can print them out too
#elements.each {|i| puts "Element was: #{i}"}
elements.each do |i|
	puts "Element was: #{i}"
end

## Personally, Emma prefers the way that's written out three lines with the 'do' command
