## same url as on the earlier exercises of this tutorial
## this one experiments with more printing and use of variables in prints and puts

puts "Mary had a little lamb."
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
puts "." * 10  #prints the string 10 times

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 #doesn't add a newline at end
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12 #adds newline at end
