/**
 * There is an in-flight entertainment system with on-demand movie streaming. Users on long flights like to watch
 * multiple movies, but it's been found that their flight often will land before they can finish the second movie.
 * So write a method that will take the total length of the flight and an array of movie lengths available,
 * and return a simple boolean that states whether there exist two movies (which are not the same movie) where 
 * the lengths equal the flight length. Assume your users will watch exactly two movies. Optimize for runtime over
 * memory.
 * Gotchas: this can be done in O(n) time and O(n) space
