<!--
  We're building a web game where everybody wins and everyone is friends forever. All a player needs
  to do is to click a button to win something. And every prize is a good prize. But something
  is going wrong. What is it?
  Gotchas: the syntax is just fine... the problem is some unexpected behavior
-->

<button id="btn-0">Button 1!</button>
<button id="btn-1">Button 2!</button>
<button id="btn-2">Button 3!</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Clean Laundry!'];
    for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
    // for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
    document.getElementByID('btn-' + btnNum).onClick = function() {
        // tell the player what they've won!
      alert(prizes[btnNum]);
    };
  }
</script>

<!--
  The user's prize is always undefined. The anonymous function that is assigned to the button's onclicks has
  access to variables in the scope outside of it (called closure). In this case, it has access to btnNum.
  And when the anonymous function accesses the variable btnNum outside of its scope, it will access whatever
  the variable is at that time, not a "frozen copy". Therefore, when a player actually clicks on a button,
  that's when it'll run line 18 and btnNum will be 3 because it has already iterated through each button.
  Therefore, the way to solve this is to pass in a variable to the anonymous function. Doing this will create a new
  variable inside of the anonymous function which will never change even as the loop iterates:
-->

<button id="btn-0">Button 1!</button>
<button id="btn-1">Button 2!</button>
<button id="btn-2">Button 3!</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var prizes = ['A Unicorn!', 'A Hug!', 'Clean Laundry!'];
  for (var btnNum = 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
    // for each of our buttons, when the user clicks it...
    document.getElementByID('btn-' + btnNum).onClick = function(frozenBtnNum) {
      // tell the player what they've won!
      alert(prizes[frozenBtnNum]);
    }(btnNum);
  }
</script>
