# We have an array of integers where:
# 1. the integers are in the range 1..n
# 2. The array has a length of n+1
# Therefore, the array must have at least one integer that appears at least twice.
# But, it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice. Write
# a function which finds any integer that appears more than once. Optimize for space!
# Gotchas: this can be done in O(n) space and less than O(n^2) time quite easily
