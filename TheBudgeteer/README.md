# The Budgeteer

This is a little spreadsheet tool that I created to help myself transition to a Google Spreadsheet budget. All of the script files can be inserted into a Google ScriptEditor in a spreadsheet, and they'll function as buttons on the top menu bar of the spreadsheet.

To play with this budget or to make your own copy of it, navigate to [this template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WL3jrNnAkKRrdOqyNyWQoGA-kMxs9ndQQkAFRu2XQWA/edit?usp=sharing), and go ahead and make a copy to your Google account. To avoid duplication, I'll just leave the Instructions sheet of that template as the source of truth for all documentation and instructions.

Good luck, and have fun budgeteering!
